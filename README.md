# 📖 Overview

ClarifAI is an AI-powered educational web application designed to help students better understand difficult study questions before attempting to solve them.

Many students struggle not because they lack knowledge, but because they have difficulty understanding what a question is actually asking.

ClarifAI addresses this problem by using **Google Gemini** to simplify complex academic questions into clear, easy-to-understand language while providing:

- ✅ A simplified version of the question
- ✅ A concise explanation
- ✅ Key concepts involved
- ✅ A helpful learning hint

Instead of immediately providing the complete solution, the application encourages conceptual understanding and independent learning.

# ❓ Problem Statement

Students frequently encounter questions in assignments, quizzes, textbooks, and examinations that contain difficult wording, technical terminology, or complex sentence structures.

This often leads to confusion before they even begin solving the problem.

Rather than immediately searching for complete solutions online, students first need help understanding what the question actually means.

ClarifAI solves this problem by transforming difficult questions into simple language while preserving their original meaning.

# 💡 Solution

# 🤖 AI Feature

The core functionality of ClarifAI is powered by **Google Gemini AI**.

Instead of generating complete answers, the model is instructed to act as an educational assistant whose purpose is to improve understanding.

For every submitted question, the AI generates four structured outputs:

1. Simplified Question
2. Explanation
3. Key Concepts
4. Helpful Hint

This ensures responses remain concise, educational, and focused on comprehension.

---

# 🧠 AI System Prompt

```text
You are an educational assistant.

Your task is NOT to solve the student's question directly.

Given a study question, return ONLY the following four sections:

1. Simplified Question
Rewrite the question in simple, easy-to-understand language.
Keep it under 25 words.

2. Explanation
Briefly explain what the question is asking.
Maximum 50 words.

3. Key Concepts
List exactly 3–4 short bullet points.

4. Helpful Hint
Provide one short hint that helps the student think about the solution.
Do not reveal the final answer.

Rules:
• Be concise.
• Do not answer the question directly.
• Keep the entire response under approximately 150 words.
• Return only the required output format.
```
